## Skin Disease Classification using CNN

This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin diseases based on images. The model is trained to recognize patterns and features in skin images, enabling accurate disease identification.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying skin diseases, providing a valuable tool for dermatological diagnosis.

## Dataset

The CNN model is trained and evaluated on the Skin Disease Dataset, containing images of various skin conditions. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure uniformity and is divided into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The final fully connected layers provide disease predictions.
